            "The AWS SDK for .NET has been updated to resolve credentials at request time, instead of resolving them when a client is instantiated (note: credentials are still cached between executions, the SDK won't attempt to retrieve them again - e.g. by calling `AssumeRole` - if they're valid from a previous call).",
            "The `FallbackCredentialsFactory` has been marked as deprecated, and the `DefaultAWSCredentialsIdentityResolver` class should be used instead. This new class follows the credential resolution order as the other AWS SDKs and will re-evaluate credentials when environment variables (such as `AWS_PROFILE`) change - which can happen in interactive PowerShell sessions.",
            "The `ImmutableCredentials` property of the `RequestContext` has been removed - as it's only applicable to AWS credentials. A new property named `Identity` is available instead (it'll be used for anonymous and token credentials as well).",
            "The `CredentialsRetriever` pipeline handler has been removed and each signer now retrieves credentials from the `Identity` property directly instead.",
            "The signature for the signer classes (such as `AWS4Signer`) has been changed as they now implement a new interface.",
