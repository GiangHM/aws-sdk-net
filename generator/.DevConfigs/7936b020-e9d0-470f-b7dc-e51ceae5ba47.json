                "In order to improve [data integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html), the AWS SDKs, including the AWS SDK for .NET, now automatically calculate checksums for all requests and responses that support it (using the `CRC32` algorithm by default). Although not recommended, you may disable the checksum validation by either: setting the `RequestChecksumCalculation` / `ResponseChecksumValidation` options of the `AmazonS3Config` to `WHEN_REQUIRED` (this will instruct the SDK to only calculate checksums when the service requires one) or setting the `DisableDefaultChecksumValidation` flag of the `PutObject` / `UploadPart` / `TransferUtilityUpload` operations to `false` (this will bypass the checksum calculations - meaning data integrity will rely only on SIGV4 payload signing and HTTPS).",
                "BREAKING CHANGE: The `CompleteMultipartUploadRequest.AddPartETags` method now only includes ETags returned by `CopyObject` and `UploadPart` operations. This only impacts use cases where multi-part uploads were performed using the low-level APIs and a checksum algorithm was explicitly specified in the `InitiateMultipartUploadRequest`; to include additional checksums (such as `ChecksumCRC32` or `ChecksumSHA256`), use the new `AddPartETagsAndChecksums` method instead."
